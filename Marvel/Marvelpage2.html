       <p> Stan Lee the man who created Hulk,Iron Man,Spider-Man,and many more. From security guard and a truck driver to an alien playboy, Stan Lee the Man has appeared in a huge number of characters spanning different setting and even different time periods. Most people take these appearances as a simple cameo,but one popular theory suggests that each cameo is a part of something far greater </p>
        <p> In the comics,everything that happens on Earth is observed by an alien entity known Uatu a.k.a the Watcher. Who occasionally intervenes in mortal affairs, even when it goes against his code. Many people believe that Stan Lee has been secretly cast this role,explaining why his characters always pop up in close proximity to Marvel's heros and why he looks the same in every film. </p>
        <p> Stan Lee's cameos span across film from dfferent studios, so if the theory is true, this would imply that all of Marvel's, Fox's and Sony's superhero movies are in fact linked together in someway. In the Marvel comics, there are alternate dimensions that the characters occasionally travel through, as seen most recently in the new Secret Wars crossover. so the Watcher omnipresence isn't completely out of the question. Maybe one day Fox should be like Sony and learn to get along with Marvel, to give the fans the MCU that we've always dreamed of.</p>
