  <p> In comics, no one stays dead for long, weither you want them to or not,and the same appears to be true in the movie adaptions as well.
   
  </p>
  <p> Nick Fury's demise in Captain America: The winter Soldier was short-lived and Agent Coulson was quickly resurrected to star in Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.,leading the question on weither the Red Skull death was as permanent as it first appeared. </p>
<p> At the end of Captain America: The First Avenger, The Red Skull was killed off by the one thing that he wanted most in the world, the Tesseract. As the Tesseract being one of the six infinity stones, it's power proved to be too gret for everyone's favorite villain, and he 'died' in the resultant explosion</p> 
<p> Many fans believe that the Red Skull didn't really die,but was actually teleported far away to the other side of the universe. Well, a similar energy effect happened when Thor used the Tesseract to teleport Loki and him back to Asgard The Avengers.</p>
<p>So there's a strong chance that the Red Skull could still be alive,hanging out with his buddy Thanos wile he thinks of a plan for revenge.</p>
